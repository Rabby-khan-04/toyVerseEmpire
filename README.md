# Milestone 11 Assignment

Backend and Database Integrate Milestone's Assignment

## About this project

- I have utilized the React Awesome Slider component for the banner section. This section dynamically loads banner images and content from a MongoDB database. The data is then displayed in a loop, allowing for a seamless presentation of the banner items.
- I have implemented a category tab using the useState() hook. Based on the selected category, I load and display data specific to that category. This allows for dynamic content presentation based on the user's category selection.
- I have incorporated the AOS package to animate the Ultron image. When the user scrolls to the section, the image slides in from the right. However, due to the page load process, there are instances where the animation may not trigger. Once the page fully loads, the animation functions correctly.
- I have implemented a search function on the "All Toys" page, allowing users to search for toys by name. The unique aspect is that the search function operates on the server side. It sends a request to the server with the search query, and the server responds with data that matches the search criteria. This approach ensures efficient and accurate search results for a seamless user experience.
- I have implemented a feature where any user can add new toys to the collection. Additionally, there is a dedicated "My Toys" page that allows users to view the toys they have personally added. This personalized page provides users with easy access to the toys they have contributed, enhancing the overall user experience and promoting engagement within the platform.
- Users can update and delete their added toys, giving them control over managing their listings.
- Implemented a custom hook for dynamic page titles on each page.
